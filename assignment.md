## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity. 

```
Scrum is a subset of the agile development methodology that is focused on transparency, inpsection and adaptation. Firstly, like other software development methodologies, Scrum can help to 
organise the IT team and provide a structure to their development process. However, by adopting Scrum, the IT team will be more responsive to development requests by stakeholdes and deliver at a greater output in a shorter duration. Internally, the team will be more productive in terms of effective collaboration between various teams, identifying potential devations and addressing them quickly as well as optimising meeting hours. 
```

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
As a borrower, I want a user-friendly catalogue system, so that I can find the books that I want easily. 
As a borrower, I want the system to recommend popular books in terms of what other readers are borrowing, so that I can spend less time chosing the books that I want to borrow. 
As a borrower, I want a review feature for the books, so that I can share my opinion on a certain book or see what other readers feel about the same book. 
As a borrwer, I want a sample feature for books, so that I can read the first chapter of the book online before deciding to borrow the book. 
As a borrower, I want an AI smart suggestion feature to recommend authors or books based on my past reads, so that I can spend less time chosing the books that I want to borrow. 



As a library staff, I want a notification system, so that borrowers are automatically reminded to return their books before the overdue date.  
As a library staff, I want the borrowing system to identify borrowers with outstanding fines, so that they are not allowed to borrow more books without clearing the payment. 


As the library management, I want a feature that can automatically categorise the borrowers in terms of their age profile and the genre of books they borrow, so that I can make a more informed decision when buying more books for the library. 
As a library management, I want to track the number of users on the website, so that I can plan new initiatives to encourage more readers to borrow books from the library.
As a library management, I want to track the overall number and frequency of books borrowed from each section of the library, so that I can justify any expansion plans for the library. 

```
